This example demonstrates an full workflow of an AI agent that makes outbound calls. It uses LiveKit SIP and Python [Agents Framework](https://github.com/livekit/agents).

It has two modes:

- **VoicePipelineAgent**: uses a voice pipeline of STT, LLM, and TTS for the call.
- **MultimodalAgent**: uses OpenAI's realtime speech to speech model.

The guide for this example is available at https://docs.livekit.io/agents/quickstarts/outbound-calls/. Make sure a SIP outbound trunk is configured before trying this example.

## Features

This example demonstrates the following features:

- Making outbound calls
- Detecting voicemail
- Looking up availability via function calling
- Detecting intent to end the call

## Dev Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies to a virtual environment:

```shell
cd outbound-caller-python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python agent.py download-files
```

Set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required values:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SIP_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID`
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` - optional, only needed for VoicePipelineAgent

Run the agent:

```shell
python3 agent.py dev
```

Now, your worker is running, and waiting for dispatches in order to make outbound calls.

### Making a call

You can dispatch an agent to make a call by using the `lk` CLI:

```shell
lk dispatch create \
  --new-room \
  --agent-name outbound-caller \
  --metadata '+1234567890'
```
